    <p>
        I enjoy building computers, so by creating somewhat of a business out of it I believe I have created a win-win
            situation for both myself and you, the consumer.<br>
        While my favourite price range to work in is $500-$700 CAD, since I believe this is where the best 
            ratio of price to performance lies, I do occasionally list computers below and above these amounts.<br>
        By purchasing a computer from me, you are guaranteed to be be receiving a well-tuned and high-performing machine.<br>
        Why buy from a corporation or a big chain who is charging a huge premium when you can buy local, save a little money,
            and get an equally if not better performing computer?<br>
